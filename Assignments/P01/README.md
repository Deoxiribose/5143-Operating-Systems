# Project Overview

This project provides a simulated filesystem and shell environment, all managed through an SQLite database. Users can register and log in, navigate directories, manage files and directories, and execute familiar shell commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `echo`, `grep`, and more. Permissions, ownership, and attributes like size and modification date are stored and enforced at the database level. By combining Pythonâ€™s SQLite integration with a command-line interface, this project offers a fully contained, virtual file manipulation experience.
